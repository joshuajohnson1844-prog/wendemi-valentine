    <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day My Love ❤️</h1>

    <p>
        Happy Valentine’s Day, my beautiful Wendemi Gedisha Maxxine Nanamus… soon to be Johnson 👀😘
        <br><br>
        Five years with you and I still feel that same pull toward you. I love you tremendously. You are the light in my life not in some cliché way, but in the real way. The way that makes me push harder. The way that makes me want to level up. The way that reminds me who I’m building all this for.
        <br><br>
        You motivate me more than you probably realize. When I think about the future, I see you in it. When I grind, I grind with us in mind. You make me want to be better spiritually, mentally, financially everything.
        <br><br>
        Now don’t get it twisted… you definitely work my nerves sometimes 😂 and we argue like two stubborn people who both think we right. But I wouldn’t trade that for anything. Because even in the tension, it’s still you. And I’d rather grow with you, laugh with you, build with you, and yes, even argue with you  than do life without you.
        <br><br>
        You’re my baby. My heart. My peace and my chaos at the same time.
        <br><br>
        I love you deeply.
        <br>
        Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️
    </p>
